# ISEE AI Tutor - Project State After Task 1

## What is this project?

The ISEE AI Tutor is a web application designed to help middle school students (grades 6-8) prepare for the Independent School Entrance Examination (ISEE). It provides personalized, AI-powered tutoring across three core areas: Mathematics, English (Reading & Vocabulary), and Essay Writing.

## Current Project State

We've completed **Task 1: Project Setup** which established the foundation. Here's what exists and why:

## 🔧 Configuration & Planning Files

### `.kiro/` Directory
- **Purpose**: Contains Kiro IDE configuration, project specifications, and development steering rules
- **Key Files**:
  - `specs/isee-ai-tutor/requirements.md` - What the app should do (user stories, acceptance criteria)
  - `specs/isee-ai-tutor/design.md` - How the app should be built (architecture, components)
  - `specs/isee-ai-tutor/tasks.md` - Step-by-step implementation plan
  - `steering/tech.md` - Technology stack and development guidelines
  - `steering/structure.md` - Project organization and naming conventions

### Root Configuration Files
- `supabase/config.toml` - Supabase (database/auth service) local development configuration
- Various package.json files - Define dependencies and scripts for each part of the project

## 🎨 Frontend Application (`frontend/`)

**Technology**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite build tool, Tailwind CSS for styling

### What's Set Up:
- **`package.json`** - Lists all the libraries we need (React, authentication, charts, forms, etc.)
- **`vite.config.ts`** - Configures the build tool that compiles and serves our app
- **`tailwind.config.js`** - Configures utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **`tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript configuration for type checking

### Application Structure:
- **`src/App.tsx`** - Main app component with routing setup (currently shows placeholder pages)
- **`src/main.tsx`** - Entry point that renders the app
- **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** - React context for managing user authentication state
- **`src/lib/supabase.ts`** - Configuration for connecting to Supabase (database/auth service)

### Component Directories (Currently Empty):
- `components/auth/` - Will contain login/register forms
- `components/practice/` - Will contain math, English, and essay practice interfaces
- `components/dashboard/` - Will contain main dashboard and navigation
- `components/progress/` - Will contain progress tracking and analytics
- `components/tutor/` - Will contain AI tutor chat interface
- `pages/` - Contains placeholder page components (Login, Dashboard, Practice pages)

## 🖥️ Backend API (`backend/`)

**Technology**: Node.js with Express framework, TypeScript

### What's Set Up:
- **`package.json`** - Lists server dependencies (Express, Supabase client, OpenAI, security middleware)
- **`src/index.ts`** - Main server file with basic routing structure
- **`src/config/supabase.ts`** - Server-side Supabase client configuration

### API Structure (Currently Placeholder):
- `routes/auth.ts` - Authentication endpoints (register, login, logout, profile)
- `routes/practice.ts` - Practice session management endpoints
- `routes/progress.ts` - Progress tracking and analytics endpoints
- `routes/tutor.ts` - AI tutor interaction endpoints
- `middleware/` - Security and authentication middleware
- `services/` - Business logic (AI integration, content management, analytics)

## 🗄️ Database (`database/`)

### `schema.sql` - Complete Database Design
This file defines all the tables and relationships needed for the app:

**User Management**:
- `users` - Student profiles (extends Supabase auth with ISEE-specific fields)
- `user_progress` - Tracks performance across subjects
- `parent_access` - Allows parents to monitor student progress

**Practice Content**:
- `math_problems` - Math questions with topics, difficulty, explanations
- `reading_passages` & `reading_questions` - Reading comprehension content
- `vocabulary_words` - Vocabulary with definitions, synonyms, examples
- `essay_prompts` - Writing prompts with rubrics

**Activity Tracking**:
- `practice_sessions` - Records of student practice activities
- `ai_interactions` - Conversations with the AI tutor
- `progress_snapshots` - Historical performance data
- `achievements` - Gamification badges and milestones

**Security Features**:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure students only see their own data
- Parent access controls for guardian monitoring

## 📋 Shared Code (`shared/`)

### `types/index.ts` - TypeScript Type Definitions
Defines the data structures used throughout the app:
- User profiles and preferences
- Practice content (math problems, reading passages, essays)
- Progress tracking and analytics
- API response formats

This ensures type safety between frontend and backend.

## 📖 Documentation

### `sample questions.md`
Contains example ISEE questions to understand the content format and difficulty levels.

## 🚀 What's Ready to Use

1. **Development Environment**: All tools and dependencies are configured
2. **Database Schema**: Complete data model is defined and ready to deploy
3. **Project Structure**: Organized codebase following best practices
4. **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript definitions ensure consistency
5. **Authentication Foundation**: Supabase integration is configured
6. **Routing**: Basic navigation structure is in place

## 🔄 What's Next

The foundation is solid, but the actual functionality needs to be built:

1. **Authentication System** - Login/register forms and user management
2. **UI Components** - Reusable buttons, forms, and layout components
3. **Practice Modules** - Interactive math, reading, and essay practice
4. **AI Integration** - OpenAI-powered tutoring and feedback
5. **Progress Tracking** - Analytics and performance visualization
6. **Content Management** - Seeding database with actual ISEE practice content

## 🎯 Key Technologies Explained

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to JavaScript for fewer bugs
- **Supabase**: Provides database, authentication, and real-time features
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API server
