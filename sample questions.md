 
The ISEE is given by consortia of schools in cities throughout the United States where schools have joined together and have chosen to use a common entrance test program.  
 
 
1.	The ISEE is given at individual school test sites at a wide variety of schools throughout the country and abroad and on a number of test dates. 
 
2.	The ISEE offers a variety of testing options. We are pleased to offer the ISEE in both a paperpencil and an online format at ISEE test site schools, ISEE testing offices, and Prometric Test Centers.  
 
Complete registration information may be found in the ISEE Student Guide, which is updated each year and is available from the independent schools who administer the test. For online registration information, visit www.iseetest.org. 
 
What Types of Questions Are on the ISEE? 
 
The first four sections are composed of multiple-choice questions. The fifth section, the essay, is not scored but requires the student to respond in his or her own handwriting to a preselected writing prompt.  
 
The first two sections, Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning, measure the applicant’s reasoning ability. 
 
•	The Middle Level Verbal Reasoning section consists of two types of items: vocabulary and sentence completion. Each vocabulary item consists of an abstract, grade-level appropriate word followed by four possible answer choices. Each sentence completion item consists of a sentence with one missing word followed by four potential answer choices. A student must select the word that most appropriately completes the context of the sentence. 
 
•	At the Middle Level, the Quantitative Reasoning section consists of word problems and quantitative comparisons. The word problems differ somewhat from traditional mathematics achievement items in that some of them require either no calculation or simple calculation. The quantitative comparison items present two quantities, (A) and (B), and ask the student to select one of the following four answer choices: 
 
(A)	The quantity in Column A is greater. 
(B)	The quantity in Column B is greater. 
(C)	The two quantities are equal. 
(D)	The relationship cannot be determined from the information given. 
 
The next two sections, Reading Comprehension and Mathematics Achievement, measure the applicant’s ability to correctly answer curriculum-based concepts that are appropriate at that grade level according to curriculum standards adopted by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM).  
 
•	In order to determine a student’s reading comprehension skills, in the Reading Comprehension section, the student is asked to read a passage and then answer items specific to that passage.   
 
The six passages in this section are age-appropriate and length-appropriate. Each passage is especially written to contain contemporary information and to be of high interest to students in the middle grades. The passages cover a variety of subject areas including arts, contemporary life, history, and science. 
 
•	Mathematics Achievement items conform to national mathematics standards and ask the student to identify the problem and find a solution to a problem. The items require one or more steps in calculating the answer. 
 
The Essay is written by the student in response to a writing “prompt” or topic that is grade-level appropriate. The prompts rotate throughout the testing season. They are designed to prompt a student to write an informed essay on a particular topic. As is true of the passages in the Reading Comprehension section, these prompts have been written for a contemporary feel and a high level of interest to current students. Each prompt is free of bias, global in scope, and representative of a wide variety of subjects. 
Each prompt is one or two sentences long and asks students to respond to the situation described. Prompts may relate to the student, to the student’s community, or to the world in general.  
 
ERB does not score the written essay. They send a copy of the essay to the school(s) designated in the ISEE registration along with the scores for the rest of the test. They do not send a copy of the essay to the parents.   
  
 
Information for Students 
 
Why Is the ISEE Required? 
 
The school you are applying to has requested ISEE scores as part of the overall admissions process. By requiring an admission test for all students entering the same grade, the school can view one common item of all applicants. The school looks at many items in conjunction with the ISEE scores, including your application, your current school records, and possibly an interview. All components of the admission process, including the ISEE scores, help the school, you, and your family determine the best school match for you. 
 
What Happens to My Scores?  
 
After you take the ISEE, the test site will send your answers to the ISEE Operations Office for scoring of the four multiple-choice sections and production of the Individual Student Report (ISR). The ISR is posted to your family’s account right after scoring and an email is then sent to notify your family that this has taken place. The essay, which is not scored and not released to the family, is released online (with the ISR) to ERB member schools. School reports do not list any recipients other than the individual school receiving the report. 
 
How Will This Book Help Me? 
 
Unlike other ISEE test preparation materials, this book was written by the same people who developed the ISEE. The sample questions and practice test questions in this book include actual questions from previous versions of the ISEE. Use this book to 
 
•	see what the ISEE looks like and how it is structured; 
•	read sample questions and answers with an explanation of each correct answer choice; 
•	read the exact directions that you will be given when you take the ISEE; 
•	take a practice test that has questions like those on the real ISEE; and 
•	use an answer sheet like the one you will use when you take the ISEE. 
 
We hope that working through this book will make you feel even more confident and prepared when you take the ISEE because you will know what to expect.
 
Information for Adults 
 
How This Book Can Help Your Student Prepare for the ISEE 
 
The information in this book offers your student an opportunity to become familiar with all aspects of the ISEE. It is particularly helpful because the sample questions and practice test questions were either chosen from previous editions of the ISEE or were written by ERB-member school faculty and administrators and by experts in test development. Using this book will allow your student to 
 
•	read and answer sample questions, check for the correct answers, and then read the explanations for why the answers are correct; 
•	take a practice test that contains questions similar to those on the actual ISEE, see a sample answer sheet that is like the answer sheet on the real test, and read the actual directions he or she will receive on the day of the test; and  
•	score the practice test and compare that score with those of other students who took the actual ISEE.  
 
How You Can Help Your Student Prepare for the ISEE 
 
There are specific ways you may help prepare your student, not only for the ISEE, but for other standardized tests as well. 
 
•	Show confidence in your student’s ability to do well on the ISEE.  
•	Remind your studebbgijrthdtihhhhjvll
•	nt that the ISEE is just one piece of information a school will use in its admission process. 
•	Mark the test date on your calendar so that both you and your student are aware of the date. 
•	Make sure that your student gets a good night’s sleep before the test. 
•	Make sure that your student eats a healthy breakfast before the test.  
•	Encourage your student to read as part of his or her daily routine. By reading new materials, your student will be exposed to new concepts and vocabulary.  
 
Reminders for Your Student 
 
Remind your student to employ the following helpful strategies when answering multiple-choice questions. 
 
•	Read the entire question before attempting to answer it. 
•	Try to answer the question without looking at the choices. Then, look at the choices to see if your answer is the same as, or close to, one of the choices. Wherever possible, answer choices on this test are arranged alphabetically, numerically, or by length of the answer to help the student locate the correct answer more quickly. 
•	Next, eliminate answers you know are not correct. 
•	Finally, choose the correct answer. If necessary, make an educated guess from the remaining choices, since there is no penalty for incorrect responses. 
Frequently Asked Questions 
 
Q: 
 	Which level of the ISEE does my student take? 
A: 
 
 	There are three levels of the ISEE.  
•	Students currently in grades 4 and 5 (applicants to grades 5 or 6) take the Lower Level.  
•	Students currently in grades 6 and 7 (applicants to grades 7 or 8) take the Middle Level. 
•	Students currently in grades 8 and above (applicants to grades 9–12) take the Upper Level.  
Q: 
 	Are there multiple versions of the ISEE? 
A: 
 	At each of the three levels, there are several different, but equivalent, forms. The specific forms to be used each year will be determined in advance by ERB. These forms are randomly assigned to the students and are statistically equivalent, regardless of which form was actually taken by the student.  
Q: 
 	How is the ISEE structured? 
A: 
 
 	Each level and each form of the ISEE has five sections. The sections are administered in the following order:  
•	Verbal Reasoning  
•	Quantitative Reasoning  
•	Reading Comprehension  
•	Mathematics Achievement 
•	Essay  
 
 	The sections and the essay are explained more fully in the next part of this book. 
Q: 
 	What can my student expect at the test site on the day of the test? 
A: 	Students will present their verification letter or identification to be checked in upon arrival.  So that your child may concentrate on doing his or her best on the ISEE, schools do not conduct admission activities or highlight their schools on the day of testing. We know that testing may be stressful for some students; therefore, the test administrators are teachers or other school personnel who teach or interact with children on a daily basis. Although test administrators may not discuss test questions during the test, they give clear test directions, and your child is encouraged to ask for clarification, if necessary, before beginning each section of the test. 

Q: 
 	What types of questions are on the ISEE? 
A: 
 	The Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, Reading Comprehension, and Mathematics Achievement sections contain only multiple-choice questions. Each question has four choices. Only one answer is the correct or “best” answer. The Essay section requires the student to write an essay in response to a prompt. There are over one hundred writing prompts (topics) that have been developed for each level of the ISEE. A different topic is selected by ERB for each test administration throughout the year. 
Q: 
 	How much time will be allotted for each section of the actual Middle Level ISEE? 
A: 	 
TIME ALLOTTED FOR EACH SECTION  
ON THE ACTUAL MIDDLE LEVEL ISEE 
Section 	Number of Questions 	Time 
Allotted 
(in minutes) 
Verbal Reasoning 	40 	20 
Quantitative Reasoning 	37 	35 
Reading Comprehension 	36 	35 
Mathematics Achievement 	47 	40 
Essay 	1 prompt 	30 
 	Total Time 	160 
	 
Each section of the ISEE (excluding the essay) contains several questions that will not be scored but may be used on future editions of the ISEE. 
 
Q: 
 	Are there any scheduled breaks during the test? 
A: 
 	There are two breaks—one following the Quantitative Reasoning section and another following the Mathematics Achievement section. Each break is five to ten minutes long. 
Q: 
 	I am confused by these acronyms: ERB, ISEE, CTP.  Didn’t my student take one of these already this year?  
A: 	The Educational Records Bureau (ERB) oversees both the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE) and the Comprehensive Testing Program (CTP). The ISEE is a test designed to help admission directors at selected public and independent schools decide who will be accepted for admission to their schools, while the CTP is a battery of tests designed to collect information about student achievement for students currently enrolled in grades 1–10.  
Both the ISEE and the CTP test student abilities in Verbal Reasoning, Reading 
Comprehension, Quantitative Reasoning, and Mathematics. They also contain similar types of items. Therefore, it is quite possible that your student may be somewhat familiar with the types of questions on the ISEE if he or she has previously taken the CTP. However, it is important to note that there is no repeat of specific items between the two tests. The ISEE is unique in that it is used for admission purposes only and its norms are based only on applicants to independent schools. 
 	
Q: 
 	Are there other books or programs that might help my student improve on the ISEE? 
A: 
 	This is the only book approved by ERB. It was written in conjunction with the test developer, Measurement Incorporated. This book contains current and accurate information.  
 
 	Since this book was written by the developer of the actual test, the sample questions and practice test questions were chosen to accurately reflect the format and the kinds of content your student will see on the actual ISEE. You may see programs or materials advertised that claim to help; however, none of them are approved by ERB, nor can they claim the intimate knowledge of the actual test questions used on this edition.  
Q: 
 	What materials does my student need to bring to the actual ISEE? 
A: 
 	For paper testing only, students should bring four #2 pencils and two pens with either blue or black ink. Students may choose to use erasable ink. 
Q: 
 	Are there materials that my student is prohibited from using during the ISEE? 
A: 
 	Most materials other than writing implements are prohibited. Specifically, scratch paper, calculators, calculator watches, rulers, protractors, compasses, dictionaries, and thesauruses are NOT permitted during the actual test.  
 
 	Cell phones and other electronic devices (iPods, MP3s, beepers, etc.) are not permitted at the test site and must not be brought into the testing room. If a student uses any of these items during the exam, his or her exam will be invalidated. Since students are not permitted to use these devices on the actual test, it is recommended that they avoid using them when they answer the sample test questions or take the practice test. A certain number of these restrictions may be waived for students who receive testing accommodations due to documented disabilities.  
Q: 
 	Are testing accommodations made if my student requires them? 
A: 	Accommodations may be made for students with documented learning differences or physical challenges. Accommodation use in school and supporting documentation of the disability are required. For more information, please go to www.iseetest.org and click on “Accommodations.” 

Q: 
 	Will my student be penalized for a wrong answer? Is it appropriate to guess? 
A: 
 	Scores are based on the number of correct answers. If the student can eliminate at least one of the choices, he or she should make an educated guess from the choices that remain. A wrong answer and an omitted answer count the same. However, it is better to move ahead to the next item and return to the puzzling one later. No student is expected to answer all questions correctly. 
Q: 
 	How is my student compared to other students taking the ISEE? 
A: 
 	Your student is compared only to other independent school applicants who tested for the same grade during the past three years. Your student is not compared to students applying to a different grade who are taking the same level of the test. The percentile ranking on the score report shows how your student scored in comparison to the other students applying to the same grade. The group of students who take the ISEE—the ISEE norming population—is a very select group of students who are applying to competitive schools. Therefore, ISEE percentile ranks are generally lower—anywhere from 10 to 40 percentile points lower—than those on other tests that use national norms. The schools that use the ISEE are familiar with ISEE scores and the group of students taking the ISEE. You may wish to check with the school(s) to which you are applying to learn the range of ISEE scores expected for applicants to their school(s). 
Q: 
 	How soon will I receive my student’s scores? 
A: 
 	After paper testing, schools send the ISEE answer sheets and essays to the ISEE Operations 
Office for production of an Individual Student Report (ISR). Scoring takes place on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The ISR is posted to a family’s online account right after scoring and an email is then sent to notify the family that this has taken place. Copies of the ISR are also posted for ERB schools and consultants, only if the family has listed them as recipients. 
The essay, which is not scored and is released only to ERB schools, accompanies the ISR. Score reports to schools do not list any other school recipients. 
For online ISEE testing at a school or Prometric site, score reports will post online 3–5 days after the exam. A notification will be emailed to let you know the report is ready. A hard copy will not be sent to the home address. 
Q: 
 	What is the raw score? 
A: 
 	A raw score represents the number correct. If a student got 23 items correct—say on a test of 40 questions—then the raw score is simply 23. 
Q: 
 	What does the scaled score mean? 
A: 	A scaled score is a raw score that has been converted to a different numerical scale, for example, 200–800. The raw score scale ranges from 0–maximum score, while the scaled score range consists of higher numbers with a somewhat arbitrary minimum and maximum score. The range of scaled scores on the ISEE is 760–940. 
 
	Q: 	To whom is my student being compared on his or her score report?  
 
A: 	As stated previously, your student is compared only to other independent school applicants who have applied to the same grade during the past three years. There is no comparison specifically to other students who took the test at the same test site or to other applicants who tested on the same day. 
 
	Q: 	What is a “good” percentile score? 
 
A: 	The notion of “good” is relative and may only be defined by the specific school. Please check with them for more information on how each plans to use the scores from the ISEE in their admission process.  
 
	Q:  	What is a stanine? 
 
A: 	A stanine score is simply another scale and is based on percentile ranks. Percentile ranks range from 1–99, while stanines range from 1–9. In general, a stanine score of 1–3 is below average, 4–6 is average, and 7–9 is above average. 
 
Percentile Rank 	Stanine 
1–3 	1 
 4 –10 	2 
11–22 	3 
23–39 	4 
40–59 	5 
60–76 	6 
77–88 	7 
89–95 	8 
96–99 	9 
 
	Q: 	Are my student’s scores good? 
 
A: 	Each school uses the scores on the ISEE as part of the total application process and according to its own criteria. Thus, there is no way to determine a “good” or “bad” score.  Each school will use several pieces of information about your student as it evaluates his or her application. These may include the student’s academic record (report card, transcript, etc.), teacher recommendation(s), notes from a personal interview, and extracurricular activities and interests. 
 
	Q: 	How will I know if my student passed or failed? 
 
A: 	Students do not pass or fail the ISEE. There is no cutoff point that determines pass/fail  status or divides students into these two groups. There is no cutoff (or pass/fail) score recommended by ERB. 
 
Q 
 	What are the schools looking for? 
A: 
 	Each independent school determines who is admitted based on a variety of criteria. Each school usually has a range of scores that, from experience, indicates if an applicant is likely to be a good fit at the school. Check with the schools to which your student is applying for more information. Remember, there are many pieces of information used in selecting applicants, and your student’s score on the ISEE is only one of these. 
Q: 
 	How does the ISEE compare with other tests? 
A: 
 	Each standardized test has its own characteristics. There is no available formal comparison between the ISEE and other national tests such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the Stanford 9, or other similar testing instruments.  
Q: 
 	How is the essay scored? 
A: 	The essay, which is not scored and not released to the parent, is released online (with the ISR) to ERB members. Evaluation is based on each individual school’s criteria.

Verbal Reasoning 
(Section 1) 
 
 
The ISEE has a Verbal Reasoning section that is composed of two different kinds of questions: 
synonyms and sentence completions. Both kinds of questions test your vocabulary and reasoning ability.  
 
Synonym questions focus on word recognition, since the correct answer choices are those that have the same meaning or are closest in meaning to the word in the question. Synonyms also test your ability to reason, because you must choose the word that is closest in meaning to the word in the question from among four answer choices.  
 
Strategy: Since the answer choices are listed in alphabetical order, think of a word that first comes to mind when you read the synonym and then look for it (or a word like it) in the list.  
 
Sentence completion questions measure your ability to understand words and their function. Correct answers are based on clues that appear in the context of the sentence. In the Middle Level ISEE, the sentence completion answer choices are words that logically complete the meaning of the sentence as a whole.  
 
Strategies:  
 
•	Read each sentence to get the overall meaning.  
•	Focus on key words or clue words in the question to help you determine the correct answer. 
•	Mentally fill in the blank with your own answer and then find the answer choice that is closest in meaning to your own answer.  
•	Remember that there is almost always a word that obviously points to the correct answer.  
•	Use word clues such as although, because, if, since, or therefore to help you figure out the relationships in the sentence.  
•	After you choose your answer, go back and reread the whole sentence to be sure that it  makes sense. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What to Expect on the ISEE  
 
Synonyms 
 
Students should be able to 
 
•	recognize many of the vocabulary words found on middle and high school graded  word lists; and 
•	select the word from the answer choices that is closest in meaning to the word in question. 
 
 
Sample Questions 
 
Directions: Answer the following sample questions by selecting the word that is most nearly the same in meaning as the word in capital letters. Darken the circle for your answer choice in the sample answer sheet at the bottom of the page. After you finish answering the questions, turn to the next page and evaluate your answers.   
 
 
1.	ABHOR 
 
(A)	conceal 
(B)	detest 
(C)	govern 
(D)	mystify 
 
2.	DRASTIC 
 
(A)	extreme 
(B)	logical 
(C)	petty 
(D)	rustic 
 
3.	DELIBERATE 
 
(A)	arbitrary 
(B)	extravagant 
(C)	intentional 
(D)	legitimate 
 
 
 
 
 
Answers to Sample Questions 
 
1.	Your task is to select the answer choice that is closest in meaning to the word “abhor.” “Abhor” means to think of something with horror or loathing, or to hate or reject something. Therefore, choice (B), detest, is the best answer.   
 
2.	“Drastic” is an adjective meaning something (such as a practice or change) that is severe or radical. Choice (A), extreme, is the best answer to this question. 
 
3.	“Deliberate” can be an adjective meaning something done with careful consideration or something done slowly; it can also be a verb meaning to consider something with care. Here you can tell it is an adjective because all the answer choices are adjectives. Choice (C), intentional, is the best answer to this question.    
What to Expect on the ISEE  
 
Sentence Completion 
 
Students should be able to 
 
• use context clues to select the word that correctly completes the sentence. 
 
 
Sample Questions 
 
Directions: Answer the following sample questions. Select the word that most correctly completes the sentence. Darken the circle for your answer choice in the sample answer sheet at the bottom of the page. After you finish answering the questions, turn to the next page and evaluate your answers. 
 
Note: To assist you in finding the right answer among the answer choices, one-word answers are listed alphabetically. 
 
 
1.	The company president hoped the board of directors would ------- to her proposal, but they rejected it because of the cost. 
 
(A)	assent 
(B)	entrust 
(C)	pretend 
(D)	react 
 
2.	With actors rushing to their places and the stage crew hurrying to move the scenery, scene changes in a theater are often -------. 
 
(A)	bashful 
(B)	defensive 
(C)	hectic 
(D)	sinister 
 
3.	The striking workers were protesting their low pay, unsafe working conditions, and rigid schedules, ------- that they wanted management to take seriously. 
 
(A)	commodities 
(B)	grievances 
(C)	hazards 
(D)	occupations 
 
 
Answers to Sample Questions 
 
1.	The structure of the sentence tells you that the company president hoped for something that did not actually happen. The board actually rejected her proposal, so you can tell that she hoped for them not to reject it. You are looking for a word that means the opposite of “reject.” Choice (A), assent, is the best answer to this question because “to assent” means “to agree.” 
 
2.	The structure of this sentence tells you that the missing word should be a description that is supported by the information in the first part of the sentence. The first part of the sentence describes people rushing and hurrying during scene changes, so you are looking for a word that describes hurried motion. Choice (C), hectic, is the best answer to this question because hectic means “characterized by activity or haste.” 
 
3.	The structure of this sentence tells you that low pay, unsafe working conditions, and rigid schedules are all things that fall into a particular category, and that the workers wanted management to take the things in that category seriously. You are looking for a word that describes the missing category. Choice (C), hazards, may be tempting because unsafe working conditions are hazards, but low pay and rigid schedules are not. Choice (B), grievances, is the best answer to this question because all three things are grievances, or complaints made about situations people consider unjust. 
 
 
Quantitative Reasoning 
(Section 2) 
 
 
Quantitative Reasoning is one of two math sections on the ISEE. This section is designed to show how your reasoning skills have developed. It tests your ability to use your understanding of mathematics to develop your own opinions about how to solve math problems. It does not test the amount of math you have learned, but how well you think mathematically. Quantitative Reasoning questions require little or no calculations; the emphasis is on your ability to reason mathematically. You may be asked to 
 
•	estimate numerical values;  
•	employ logic to determine what a particular problem is about; 
•	compare and contrast quantities;  
•	analyze and interpret data;  
•	analyze, compare, predict, draw conclusions, and summarize graphs;  
•	use reason to calculate the probability of events; 
•	understand concepts and applications of measurements; and 
•	know how to arrive at statistical solutions to problems that are given.   
 
All questions found in the two math sections of the ISEE are linked to the NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) Standards. The ISEE uses the following NCTM strands as a basis for the Quantitative Reasoning section: 
 
•	Numbers and Operations 
•	Algebra  
•	Geometry 
•	Measurement 
•	Data Analysis and Probability 
•	Problem Solving 
 
In the Quantitative Reasoning section of the Individual Student Report (ISR), these strands are NOT identified. However, to help you best prepare for this section of the ISEE, the answers to the practice test questions are identified by the NCTM standards. For more information on these strands, visit the NCTM Web site at www.nctm.org. 
 
This section has two types of questions: word problems and quantitative comparison questions. 
 
Strategies for Word Problems:  
 
•	Read the question and determine exactly what you are being asked to find. 
•	Determine what information is relevant and what is irrelevant.  
•	Cross out the irrelevant information in your test booklet. 
•	Next, ask yourself, “What steps do I need to use to find the answer?” and “Can I do this by estimating and not by actual calculations?” 
•	Make a best guess at the correct answer, then look to see if that answer is given.  
(Note: On the ISEE, all answer choices are listed in sequential order from greatest to least, or least to greatest.) 
•	Next, eliminate all answer choices that are not reasonable. 
•	Since there is no penalty for guessing, choose the answer that seems most reasonable. 
 
Remember, there is only one correct answer for each question. The answer choices often represent common mistakes or misconceptions, but they are not intended to trick you. You may write in the test booklet. 
 
Strategies for Quantitative Comparison Questions: 
 
•	The quantitative comparison questions are not in the standard question format found in other sections of this test, but rather two quantities are to be compared. The quantities are shown in two columns: Column A and Column B.   
•	All comparison questions have the same four answer choices. To save you time in reading the questions, the answer choices in this subsection are not given after each question, but are shown at the top of each page. The answer choices for all questions in this subsection are: 
 
(A)	The quantity in Column A is greater. 
(B)	The quantity in Column B is greater. 
(C)	The two quantities are equal. 
(D)	The relationship cannot be determined from the information given. 
 
•	Before doing any mental math or calculations to compare the quantities, first determine if you have enough information to compare the quantities. If not, choose answer D: “The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.”  
•	If you need to do calculations to compare the quantities, when possible, make estimates of the quantities and write your estimate in its corresponding column.  
•	Since there is limited reading required in this section, many questions show only the two quantities you are to compare. However, some questions give additional information before or after the quantities you are to compare; therefore, be sure you read all the information given very carefully before answering the question. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Numbers and Operations  
 
Students should be able to 
 
• analyze, perform operations on, and compare integers, fractions, decimals, and percents. 
 
 
Sample Questions 
 
Directions: Answer the following sample questions. To answer the first question, select the answer that best illustrates numbers and operations. Darken the circle for your answer choice in the sample answer sheet at the bottom of the page.  
 
 
 1. Chris has a basket of apples, 40% of which are red. The rest of the apples are green. If the basket contains 6 red apples, how many green apples does it contain?

Answers to Sample Questions 
 
Sample Question 1: 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (C), 9. 
 
One way to solve this problem is to think that since 40% of the apples are red and the rest of the apples are green, (100% − 40%) or 60% of the remaining apples are green. Six red apples make up 40% of the basket, which means that there are 3 apples for every 20%. So, 9 apples would make up 60% of the basket at 3 apples per 20%.   
 
The problem could also be solved by first recognizing that 6 red apples make up 40% of the total number of apples in the basket. Since the rest of the apples in the basket are green, this leaves 60% green apples in the basket. Then, set up a proportion problem, as shown, and solve for the unknown: 
 
	.40	.60
	 			; x = the number of green apples; 
	6	x
 	.40x = 3.6;  	     x = 9. 
 
So, 9 apples are green. Thus, the correct answer to this problem is answer choice (C). 
 
 
Sample Question 2: 
 	  
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (B): The quantity in Column B is greater. 
 
One way to find the answer is to round the value in column A up to 1 and round the value in 
	Column B down to 	8 and realize that 	8 > 1. 
 
Another way to solve the problem is to calculate the value in Column A as 0.9 and the value in Column B as 2.85.

Answers to Sample Questions 
 
Sample Question 1: 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (B), 90M – 1,000 = 30M. 
 
One way to solve this problem is to recognize that Michael’s speed is represented by M, and Jack’s speed is represented by 3M. Since distance is equal to the rate times the time, both Michael’s and Jack’s distance after 30 minutes would be as shown:  
 
 	 Michael’s Distance = M(30) or 30M  	 Jack’s Distance = 3M(30) or 90M 
 
which gives the equations shown: 
 
	 	 90M – 30M = 1,000 
 
	 	 or 
 
	 	 90M – 1,000 = 30M. 
 
Thus, the correct answer is answer choice (B). 
 
 
Sample Question 2: 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (A): The quantity in A is greater. 
 
One way the answer can be found is: 
 x
 	Solve for x: 	  + 5 = 25; 4
 	  	 	x
  = 20; 
4
 	   	 
 	 x = 80. 
 	Solve for y: 	6y + 11 = 77; 
 	  	 	6y = 66; 
 	  	 	y = 11. 
 
Thus, choice (A) is correct.

Answers to Sample Questions 
 
Sample Question 1: 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (B), median. 
 
To find the answer to this problem, consider the fact that the median score is the average of the two middle scores (the 8th and 9th scores) because there are an even number of scores in the data set. The histogram shows that the 8th score is located in the range from 61 to 70, while the 9th score is located in the range from 71 to 80. Therefore, the 8th and 9th scores must be different values because they are not found in the same range of scores. The average of the 8th and 9th scores will lie between these scores. Thus, you will never get a score for the median that is in the data set.   
 
Sample Question 2: 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (C): The two quantities are equal. 
Since there are 12 possible sums, the probability of any particular result is  
Column A:  The sum of 3 appears twice, so the probability of getting a sum of 3 is   . 
Column B:  The sum of 6 appears twice, so the probability of getting a sum of 6 is   . 
Since  , the correct answer is answer choice (C). 
 
Reading Comprehension  
(Section 3) 
 
 
The actual Middle Level Reading Comprehension section of the ISEE contains six reading passages; the practice test in this book contains five passages. The passages include topics related to history, science, literature, and contemporary life. Some questions ask you to find a phrase or word in the passage, so all passages show line numbers in the left margin. Each passage is followed by six questions about the passage.  
 
Strategy: Read the passage first to get an overall view. As you read the passage, ask yourself, “What is the main idea? What facts and details are given?” As you answer the questions following the passage, use the line numbers to help you find the section or lines you may need to look at again. 
 
A sample passage and questions may be found on the next two pages. The types of questions you may be asked focus on six categories:  
 
•	The Main Idea items assess the student’s ability to look for an overall message, theme, or central idea in the passage or section of the passage. 
•	The Supporting Ideas items assess the student’s ability to identify explicit ideas that support the main idea or another important concept found in the text. 
•	Inference items ask the student to draw a conclusion from content not explicitly stated in the text.  Inference items may ask the student to compare and contrast ideas, interpret or analyze text, and/or predict subsequent events or outcomes.  
•	Vocabulary items deal with word definitions within the context of the passage, usually in the form of “most nearly means.” 
•	Organization/Logic items ask students to identify the sequence, pattern, relationship, structure, or summary of the passage and to identify the major features of different literary genres, including narrative, informational, and instructional. 
•	Tone/Style/Figurative Language items assess the student’s understanding of mood, tone, point of view, and figurative language such as simile, metaphor, images, irony, and personification. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sample Passage 
 
The sample passage is followed by six questions based on its content.  
 
 
1	It is often said that elephants are particularly 
2	afraid of mice. But there is abundant evidence 
3	that this is not the case. According to the 
4	director of the National Zoological Park in 
5	Washington, D.C., the elephants in the zoo pay 
6	no attention whatever to the many mice that turn 
7	up in the elephants’ hay. Nor is there any 
8	evidence that elephants in the wild exhibit any 
9	particular fear of mice. Of course it is quite 
10	possible that individual elephants may have 
11	such a fear, but most zoologists who have 12 experience with wild elephants say that their  
13	two greatest fears are dogs and human beings.
14	Yet the belief that elephants have a particular 
15	fear of mice is very persistent. Many years ago, 
16	a popular writer asserted that elephants are 
17	afraid of mice because small mouse-like animals 
18	found in their wild haunts sometimes crawl up 
19	the trunks of the huge beasts when they are 
20	feeding and dig their claws into the elephants’ 
21	trunks. The elephants become frantic and blow 22 violently but are unable to dislodge the mice. 23 This story, which has captured the imaginations 24 of many, is almost certainly pure fiction.

Answers to Sample Questions 
 
This passage describes the myth that elephants are afraid of mice and presents evidence to show that this myth is not actually true. 
 
Sample Question 1: 
 
This item asks you to determine the main purpose of the passage. Choice (B) is the correct answer because the passage presents an argument against the myth that elephants are afraid of mice. Choice (A) is a supporting idea, choice (C) is information that is not provided in the passage, and choice (D) is an implication that cannot be made from the passage. 
 
Sample Question 2: 
 
This item asks you to determine which statement can be supported based on information that is given in the passage. There is no information in the passage about whether elephants fear things they have not seen, whether elephants in the wild fear different things from elephants in captivity, or whether elephants can fear things other than themselves. You can find the correct answer, (A), in lines 10 –11, which imply that elephants fear different things by saying that “individual elephants may have such a fear.”  
 
Sample Question 3: 
 
Your task here is to determine which best reflects the attitude of elephants toward mice. You can find the answer in lines 5 –7, which describe how the elephants at the National Zoo behave toward mice.  They “pay no attention” to them, which tells you that their attitude is (C), indifference. 
 
Sample Question 4: 
 
Your task here is to identify the meaning of the word “asserted.” “Asserted” most nearly means argued or claimed, so the correct answer is (A). To assert something is not to actually discover or prove it, so (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
 
Sample Question 5: 
 
This item asks you to understand the figurative meaning of the phrase “found in their wild haunts.”  “Haunts” here is used to mean a place where elephants are commonly found, not a place that is literally haunted. Therefore the correct answer is (C).   
 
Sample Question 6: 
 
This question asks you to determine how the passage is organized. The passage presents evidence against a popular view, so the correct answer is (C). It does not present contradictory evidence or a series of problems, and the author’s opinion in the passage does not change, so (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect. 
 
Mathematics Achievement 
(Section 4) 
 
 
Mathematics Achievement tests mathematical skills you have learned from the very beginning of your school career. All questions in this section are aligned to the standards articulated by the NCTM. As with the questions in the Quantitative Reasoning section, this section will include questions from these NCTM standards:  
 
•	Number and Operations 
•	Algebra 
•	Geometry  
•	Measurement 
•	Data Analysis and Probability, and  
•	Problem Solving  
 
For more information on these mathematical standards, visit www.nctm.org. 
 
The Mathematics Achievement section will test your ability to identify and solve problems related to the NCTM standards in the six areas listed above. Specifically, the Mathematic Achievement questions have these characteristics: 
 
•	Unlike the Quantitative Reasoning section, you may need to do calculations to determine the correct answer for some questions.   
•	Answer choices may represent misconceptions or procedural errors (such as incorrect order of mathematical operations in a multi-step problem) but there are no trick questions or trick answers.   
•	Unlike the Quantitative Reasoning section, some items may require knowledge of mathematical terminology as indicated in the grade appropriate NCTM standards.   
•	Although conversions between units of measurement may be required to correctly answer the problem, students do not have to memorize conversions in the U.S. standard system (such as twelve inches equals one foot). If conversions within the U.S. standard system are required to find the correct answer to the question, they are given in the question.  
•	Common metric units will be found in some questions in this section, but conversions within the same unit for volume, length, mass, or temperature in the metric system are not provided (i.e., conversions between centimeters and meters). 
 
You may not use a calculator or scratch paper. You may write in this book, since you may write in the test booklet when you take the ISEE.  
 
 
Strategies:  
 
•	Read the entire question and study any related graphic images for each question before looking at the answer choices.   
•	Remember all four answer choices are logical answers—there are no answer choices such as “all of the above” or “none of the above.”  
•	Next determine your answer and look for it in the answer choices provided.   
o To save you time, all answers are listed in sequential order from greatest to least, or least to greatest, unless the answer could be determined by using the ordered answers. (For example, a question which asks which number is the largest number would not have its answer choices ordered by value.)  
•	Remember to check your work, since often the answer choices represent common mathematical mistakes or procedural misconceptions.   
•	Some questions may be unfamiliar to you because you may not have yet covered that particular math concept at your current school. If you do not know the answer to the question, or if the answer you have determined is not listed as an answer choice, you may choose to make a mark in your test booklet (not your answer document), skip that question for now, and move on to the next question. Remember all questions on the ISEE have equal value. If you have time before the end of this test section, you may be able to come back to it later.

 1. What is the least common multiple of 8, 10, and 12? 
 
(A) 2 (B) 4 
(C)	120 
(D)	960 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Answer to Sample Question 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (C), 120. 
 
One way to solve this problem is to factor each number into its prime factorization, as shown: 
 
8 = 2  2  2; 10 = 2  5; 12 = 2  2  3. 
 
The factor 2 appears 3 times in 8, so use 2  2  2 as factors of the least common multiple. 
 
The factor 5 appears 1 time in 10, so use 5 as a factor of the least common multiple. 
 
The factor 3 appears 1 time in 12, so use 3 as a factor of the least common multiple. 
 
Now multiply these factors:  2  2  2  5  3. 
 
So, the least common multiple is:   2  2  2  5  3 = 120. 
 
Thus, the correct answer to this question is answer choice (C).

 1. A clothing store had shirts on sale at 20% off the regular price. The store then took an additional 10% off the sale price. What is the final price of a shirt originally priced at $50? 
 
(A) $35 (B) $36 
(C) $40 (D) $45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Answer to Sample Question 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (B), 36. 
 
One way to solve this problem is to recognize that the regular price of the shirt is $50.   
 
A 20% discount means that the new selling price is (100%  20%) or 80% of the original price or $[0.80(50)].  
 
An additional 10% off means that a person would pay (100%  10%) or 90% of the already reduced price of $[0.80(50)].   
 
0.90[(0.80)(50)] = 36. 
 
Thus, the final price is $36, so the correct answer is answer choice (B).

(A)	12 (B) 6 (C) –1 
(D) –12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Answers to Sample Questions 
 
Sample Question 1: 
 
The correct answer is answer choice (D), T = 0.6(n – 1) + 2. 
 
One way to solve this problem is to first recognize that the value of n includes the first hour of parking at a rate of $2.00 for that first hour.    
 
To find the number of hours parked beyond the first hour, subtract the first hour from the total number of hours parked, (n – 1). 
 
To find the cost of parking beyond the first hour, multiply the number of additional hours by $0.60:  0.60(n – 1) or 0.6(n – 1). 
 
Finally, add the cost of parking for the first hour ($2.00) to the cost of parking each additional hour:  0.6(n – 1) + 2. 
 
Thus, T = 0.6(n – 1) + 2, so the correct answer is answer choice (D). 
 
 
Sample Question 2: 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (D), −12. 
 
One way to solve this problem is to multiply each fraction by the least common denominator (12x) and then solve for x.   
 
	x 3	9
 	= 	 x	12
 	12(x + 3) = 9x 
 	12x + 36 = 9x 
 	3x = −36  	x = −12 
 
So, the correct answer is answer choice (D).

 1. A trapezoid is shown. 
 
 
Note: Area of a trapezoid =   (b1 + b2)h. 
 
What is the height, h, of the trapezoid shown, if the area is 78cm2? 
 
(A) 3.5 cm (B) 6.0 cm 
(C)	9.1 cm 
(D)	15.6 cm 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 	 
 
Answer to Sample Question 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (B), 6.0 cm. 
 
One way to solve this problem is to solve for h in the equation:   
 
78 =   (18 + 8)h; 
 
78 =   (26)h;

Answers to Sample Questions 
 
Sample Question 1: 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (C), 22. 
 
One way to solve this problem is to count the number of leaves— the total number of digits to the right of the vertical line.   
 
There are 22 leaves, so the correct answer is answer choice (C). 
 
 
Sample Question 2: 
 
The correct answer to this question is answer choice (B),   . 
 
One way to solve this problem is to realize that you are selecting one marble out of 13 total marbles  (4 + 3 + 6); however, there are 6 green marbles, so you have not one but 6 chances out of 13 to select a green marble.   
 
So, the correct answer to this question is answer choice (B).   
 
Note:  On the ISEE, answer choices are ordered by quantity (unless their order would indicate the correct answer). In this question, they are ordered from greatest to least. 
  
 
Writing the Essay 
(Section 5) 
 
 
On the last section of the ISEE test, you will be asked to write a short essay in response to an assigned writing prompt. A writing prompt is randomly selected for use on each test date. The writing prompts include topics of interest to students at your level and are created to give you an opportunity to tell more about yourself.  
 
This part of the test also gives you a chance to show the schools to which you have applied how well you organize your thoughts and express them in a written format. For the actual ISEE test, you are given a sheet of paper on which to make notes. You must write the essay in ink on two pre-lined pages (erasable ink is allowed), and you also must rewrite the prompt at the top of the first page. The actual instructions you will receive when you take the essay portion of the ISEE are shown on pages 118–119 in the “Practice Test” section.  
 
You are given 30 minutes to complete the essay. During those 30 minutes you should 
 
•	organize your thoughts; 
•	prepare your notes or make a short outline; and  • write your final copy. 
 
Writing must be done either in cursive or print using a ballpoint pen. The writing should be done directly on the lines preprinted in the answer document, using blue or black ink.  
 
On the following pages, you will find some tips for writing an essay, some sample essay prompts, and lined pages for writing a sample essay. Three sample essay topics and three sets of lined pages have been provided to give you an opportunity to practice on more than one prompt. Remember to add descriptions and details in your response. If possible, you should ask a parent or teacher to read your essay(s) and give you feedback on what you have written.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sample Test Questions – Essay 
 
Tips for Writing the Essay 
 
Here is a brief writing checklist designed to help you organize and write a response to the essay topic provided. This checklist is for your use now, but note that there is NO checklist for you to use when you take the actual ISEE, and you may NOT take a checklist into the test with you. We believe, however, that if you use this checklist as you write your sample essay, you will remember to ask yourself these questions when you write your essay on the actual ISEE.   
 
__ Did I put the topic in the box at the top of the first page, as instructed?  
 
__ Did I plan my essay before putting it on the lined sheets?   
 
__ Did I allow enough time to write my final copy on the lined sheets?  
  
__ Did I write about the topic that was given? 
 
__ Did I include details to add interest? 
 
__ Did I follow rules for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization? 
 
__ Can others read my handwriting? 
 
__ Did I review my writing upon finishing?
