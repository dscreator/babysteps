#### Coverage Configuration

**Frontend Coverage (Vite + Vitest)**
- Configured coverage thresholds: 75% for branches, functions, lines, and statements
- Excluded test files, node_modules, and build artifacts from coverage
- Multiple reporter formats: text, JSON, and HTML

**Backend Coverage (Vitest)**

- Integrated coverage reporting with CI/CD pipeline support

### 12.2 Integration and End-to-End Testing

#### Integration Testing

**Frontend Integration Tests**

  - Practice session lifecycle (create → submit answers → end session)
  - Progress tracking integration with real data flow
  - AI service integration with proper error handling
  - Data validation across all endpoints
  - Database connection and error recovery testing

#### End-to-End Testing (Playwright)

**Configuration**
- `frontend/playwright.config.ts`: Multi-browser testing setup
  - Desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - Mobile browsers: Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
  - Automatic dev server startup for testing
  - Trace collection for debugging failed tests

**E2E Test Suites**
- `frontend/e2e/auth.spec.ts`: Authentication user journeys

  - Form validation and error handling
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing
  - Responsive design validation

- `frontend/e2e/practice.spec.ts`: Practice module workflows
  - Math practice: problem display, answer submission, feedback
  - English practice: reading comprehension and vocabulary
  - Essay practice: writing interface and AI analysis
  - Session management and progress tracking
  - Cross-device functionality testing

#### Performance Testing

**Performance Test Suite**
- `backend/src/__tests__/performance.test.ts`: Comprehensive performance validation
  - API response time benchmarking (health checks < 100ms, practice sessions < 500ms)
  - Concurrent request handling (10 simultaneous requests < 2 seconds)
  - Memory leak detection during repeated operations
  - Database query performance testing with simulated delays
  - AI service performance testing with timeout handling
  - Load testing with burst requests (50 requests < 10 seconds)
  - Response quality maintenance under load

## Key Features Implemented

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Purpose**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Coverage**: All critical business logic, validation functions, and utility methods
- **Approach**: Fast, focused tests with minimal dependencies

### Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between different parts of the system
- **Coverage**: API endpoints, database operations, service integrations
- **Approach**: Test real workflows with controlled external dependencies

### End-to-End Tests
