- Conditional insight generation based on performance levels
- Responsive grid layout for metrics display

## Updated ProgressPage

**Location**: `frontend/src/pages/ProgressPage.tsx`

**Major Changes**:
- Complete redesign from placeholder to fully functional page
- Subject selection tabs for detailed analysis
- Responsive grid layout (2/3 main content, 1/3 sidebar)
- Integration with existing data services and hooks

**Layout Structure**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Subject Selection Tabs              │                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤                 │
│ Performance Chart                   │                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤ Streak Tracker │
│ Topic Breakdown Chart               │                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤                 │
│ Progress Summary                    │                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┤                 │
                                      │ Achievement     │
                                      │ Badges          │
                                      └─────────────────┘
```

## Data Integration

### Service Integration
- **useDashboardData**: Provides overall progress metrics, streaks, and achievements
- **useDetailedProgress**: Supplies subject-specific performance data and trends
- **Mock Data Support**: Comprehensive mock data for development and testing

### Data Flow
1. ProgressPage fetches dashboard data on mount
2. Subject selection triggers detailed progress data fetch
3. Components receive typed data through props
4. Real-time updates through React Query caching and refetching

## Chart.js Configuration

### Performance Optimizations
- Chart.js component registration for tree-shaking
- Responsive chart configuration with `maintainAspectRatio: false`
- Efficient data transformation and memoization
- Proper cleanup and memory management

### Styling Consistency
- Consistent color palette across all charts
- Tailwind CSS integration for responsive design
- Custom tooltip styling matching application theme
- Accessibility considerations with proper contrast ratios

## Responsive Design
