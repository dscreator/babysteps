#### Spaced Repetition Algorithm

The implementation uses the SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm:

```typescript
// Spaced repetition calculation
if (quality < 3) {
  // Incorrect response - reset
  newRepetitions = 0
  newInterval = 1
  newEaseFactor = data.easeFactor
} else {
  // Correct response
  newRepetitions = data.repetitions + 1
  newEaseFactor = Math.max(1.3, data.easeFactor + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02)))

  if (newRepetitions === 1) {
    newInterval = 1
  } else if (newRepetitions === 2) {
    newInterval = 6
  } else {
    newInterval = Math.round(data.interval * newEaseFactor)
  }
}
```

**Rating System:**
- Again (0): Show word more frequently
- Hard (2): Review in a few days
- Medium (3): Review in a week
- Easy (5): Review in 2+ weeks
