- **Row Level Security**: Implemented proper RLS policies for data privacy
- **Access Code Generation**: Created PostgreSQL function for secure code generation

#### Core Services
- **ParentService**: Complete CRUD operations for parent accounts
  - Account creation with automatic student access requests
  - Secure login/logout functionality
  - Student linking with access code verification
  - Dashboard data aggregation with privacy filtering
  - Notification preferences management

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/parent/register` - Parent account creation
- `POST /api/parent/login` - Parent authentication
- `GET /api/parent/students` - List linked students
- `POST /api/parent/students/link` - Request student access
- `GET /api/parent/dashboard/:studentId` - Get dashboard data
- `PUT /api/parent/preferences/notifications` - Update notification settings
- `POST /api/student/parent/grant-access` - Student grants parent access

#### Data Privacy & Security
- Parents only see aggregated progress data, not specific answers
- Access requires student approval via secure codes
- All data filtered through privacy-compliant methods
- Proper authentication and authorization checks

### Frontend Implementation

#### Authentication System
- **ParentAuthContext**: Separate authentication context for parents
- **ParentLogin Component**: Login/registration flow with validation
- **Session Management**: Token-based authentication with local storage

#### Dashboard Components
- **ParentDashboard**: Main dashboard with student selection and data display
- **StudentSelector**: Multi-child support with access status indicators
- **ProgressOverview**: Subject-wise performance with visual progress bars
- **EngagementMetrics**: Study habits, streaks, and consistency tracking
- **StudyConsistency**: Visual calendar and streak information
- **RecentActivity**: Timeline of recent practice sessions

#### Student-Side Components
- **GrantParentAccess**: Modal for students to approve parent access
- **Access Code Input**: Secure code entry with validation
- **Privacy Information**: Clear explanation of what parents can see

#### Key Features
- Real-time progress tracking across all subjects
- Visual consistency indicators and streak tracking
- Engagement metrics with motivational messaging
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Clear privacy boundaries and data filtering

## Task 10.2: Notification System and Email Integration

### Backend Implementation

#### Email Service Integration
- **Resend Integration**: Professional email delivery service
- **Template System**: HTML and text email templates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when email service unavailable

#### Notification Types
1. **Progress Milestones**: Significant score improvements, streak achievements
2. **Study Reminders**: Automated reminders for inactive students
3. **Weekly Reports**: Comprehensive progress summaries every Sunday
4. **Access Requests**: Secure codes for parent-student linking

#### Automated Scheduling
- **NotificationScheduler**: Background service with multiple intervals
- **Smart Triggers**: Context-aware notification logic
- **Preference Filtering**: Respects parent notification preferences
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient database queries and batching

#### Email Templates
- **Progress Milestones**: Celebration emails with achievement details
- **Study Reminders**: Gentle encouragement with streak risk warnings
- **Weekly Reports**: Comprehensive analytics with recommendations
- **Access Requests**: Clear instructions with security information

### Frontend Implementation

#### Notification Preferences
- **NotificationPreferences Component**: Toggle switches for each notification type
- **Email Frequency Settings**: Daily, weekly, or monthly options
- **Privacy Information**: Clear explanation of data usage
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate preference saving

#### Integration Points
- **Parent Dashboard**: Settings accessible from main dashboard
- **Student Dashboard**: Link to parent dashboard in navigation
- **Access Management**: Clear workflow for granting/revoking access

## Technical Architecture

### Security Measures
- **Access Codes**: 8-character secure codes with expiration
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **Token Authentication**: Separate auth flows for parents and students
- **Data Filtering**: Privacy-compliant data aggregation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- **Caching Strategy**: React Query for client-side caching
- **Background Processing**: Automated notifications without blocking requests
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout the system

### Scalability Considerations
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate services for different concerns
- **Database Indexing**: Proper indexes for parent-student relationships
- **Email Queuing**: Batch processing for notification delivery
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management
